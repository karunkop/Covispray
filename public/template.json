This protective film helps to prevent contaminants from coming into contact with the nasal surface. The osmotic properties of covispray Nasal Spray attract hypotonic fluid present in the mucosal tissue, creating a flow of fluid from the interior to the surface. The mechanical mode of action makes it possible to continuously block and detach impurities and other contaminants including viruses present inside the nose and eventually omit them with nasal secretions."
